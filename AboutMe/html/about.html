				I was born in Mexico City, Mexico on November 7, 1998.  I came to the United States at the age of 7.  My parents brought me to th US in hopes of giving me and my family a better life.  I know the sacrifice thaty they had to make coming to a new country.  I did well in high school, taking advanced classes but when it came time to picking a carrer and picking a college in which to study, I came to the realization that it is very expensive to go to college in the US.

				I always enjoyed using computers and I did some research and found programming.  I did some coding on Code Academy to see if I would like pursuing a carrer in programming.  Turns out I really enjoy it.
				Next step was looking for a way to get into the industry without having to pay tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars to a university and I found coding bootcamps.  They sounded like a great opportunity and a cheaper alternative to a university.  So I applied to NYCDA and here I am, hoping to get into the industry and hopefully paying back my parents for all they did to me.
